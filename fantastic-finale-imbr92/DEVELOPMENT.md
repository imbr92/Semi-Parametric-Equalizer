11/16 -- Made basic GUI with ofxGui and hooked up an MP3 file to confirm functionality Play and Load buttons.
11/17-19 -- Failed at using ofxAudifile, ofxFft and ofxSoundObjects due to lack of documentation and lack of knowledge about threads and DSP.
11/20 -- Made Polynomial.h and Polynomial.cpp to simplify the math involved in the project with abstraction. 
12/1 -- Read articles about the DSP theory behind Equalizers and FFT. Then read documentation of FFTW and libsndfile libraries.
